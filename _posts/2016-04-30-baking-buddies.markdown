project-details: 'Optimizely is a firm that makes customer-experience optimization software for companies. They tasked me to create a mascot representing their internal UI pattern library, OUI. French for “yes” and pronounced like “we”, this was a great opportunity to explore mascot designs with a French flair. '

      <h2>Concept Sketches</h2>
      <p>Initially, while brainstormed animal concepts, I was thinking French bulldogs, poodles, cats and frogs would be fun possibilities. And being that Optimizely is known for A/B testing, I wanted to play with different French elements of travel and movement.</p>

      <h2>Refined Sketches</h2>
      <p>A front-facing French bulldog was the favorite concept out of the bunch. With that direction in mind, I then tried out different facial expressions that would pair with the French bulldog. The friendliest dog from the group was the one that was chosen.</p>
