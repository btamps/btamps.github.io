    <h2>Brainstorming Concept Sketches</h2>
    <p>For the initial concepts, I was thinking of French bulldogs, poodles, frogs for possible animals. And since Optimizely is all about the A/B testing, I wanted to play with French elements of travel and movement.</p>

    <h2>Refined Sketches</h2>
    <p>A front-facing French bulldog was the favorite concept out of the bunch. Going with that direction, I then tried out different facial expressions for the dog. The friendliest looking one was the chosen.</p>
