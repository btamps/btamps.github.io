    <h2>Brainstorming Concept Sketches</h2>
    <p>For the initial animal concepts, I was thinking French bulldogs, poodles, cats and frogs would be fun possibilities. And being that Optimizely is known for A/B testing, I wanted to play with different French elements of travel and movement.</p>

    <h2>Refined Sketches</h2>
    <p>A front-facing French bulldog was the favorite concept out of the bunch. Going with that direction, I then tried out different facial expressions for the dog. The one that looked the friendliest was chosen.</p>
