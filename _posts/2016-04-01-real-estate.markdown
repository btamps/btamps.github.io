      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p>Elenna Tamplin is a real estate agent in the Tampa Bay Area. To help current and potential clients, Elenna needed a better way to communicate each step of the home buying and selling process. The goal was to create a visually informative guide that made the real estate process easier to understand and align expectations for all parties.</p>

          <h3>Home Buyers and Sellers Experience</h3>
          <p>Illustrations were requested to visually represent the major milestones of the home-buying and selling experience. My first step to determine the key illustrations needed was sit down with Elenna and have her explain the processes to me in words. Once I believed I had full understanding of the processes, I later distilled each step into a concept was both simple and relatable. I wanted to make sure each visual could connect with all customers. A detailed, comprehensive visual of the process builds trusts before a conversation starts.</p>
