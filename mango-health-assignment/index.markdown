        <p>This is my response to Mango Health’s visual design assignment. My goal is for the design team to gain a good understanding of my thought process, my approach to problem solving, and my illustrative exploration.</p>

        <h2>My Choice: Tips On Getting Started</h2>

      <div class="col-sm-8 description center">
        <p>I thought the first two illustrations conveyed their messaging well, while the third illustration for “Tips on Getting Started” seemed a little vague. Since I felt the 3rd illustration could better communicate its message, I chose this to be the option I work on.</p>

        <h4>What is the image trying to communicate?</h4>
        <p>This image is trying to communicate tips on getting started when the user first uses the app. Illustrations of a medicine bottle and a hand suggest inputting prescriptions into the app.</p>

        <h4>Is it doing a good job? Why or why not?</h4>
        <p>Although the image does imply users to enter in medications, it does not give insight of what the “tips” are for getting started. The content for tips mention, by using Mango Health everyday, the user will be able to earn points and level up. Leveling up grants more chances to win rewards every week in a raffle.</p>
        <p>I provided some suggestions of how I would communicate this better through illustrations below.</p>

        <h4>Option 1</h4>
        <h2>Friendly Greeting People</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-12">
        <p>From my experience in Marketing, users tend to resonate with illustrations of people. Even though no tips are shown in the image, I thought showing illustrated people would entice new users to click and view the content. This image is saying, “Hey there. Let’s make the most out of this app.”</p>
        <p>While sketching these people, I was inspired by the simple, clean shapes of medication shown in the app. I wanted to create people in a round, tablet-shaped pill design style, which would pair well with other shapes used in the app.</p>

          <h3>Pros</h3>

            <li>Illustrations of people can grab the attention of new app users</li>
            <li>Colorful style and simple shapes matches current branding</li>

        <h2>Bring the Gifts Forward</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-12">
        <p>I thought it would be great idea to pull out items you can purchase with the Mango Health’s rewards. Seeing the actual items is a great way to bring the value forward and motivate users to continue using the app.</p>
        <p>I also took this time to explore a line-art “outer-stroke” illustration style.</p>

            <li>Although, it does a great job of showing user what they can win, it doesn't show other “tips”, like entering in medications.</li>
            <li>While other options are just images, this option requires extra copy</li>
            <li>Only shows one reward at a time</li>
            <li>The outer-stroke style doesn't quite match current branding</li>
            <li>Extra height of the card pushes the other content blocks down</li>

        <h4>My Recommendation</h4>
        <h2>3-Step Progression</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-12">
        <p>I wanted to create an illustration that would give more insight into the contents of “tips on getting started”. My idea here is to show the user’s journey with Mango Health. By adding medication and taking them on time, the user can earn points and win gifts. It was also important to visually show progression through these different features of the Mango Health app.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="row sketches">
      <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
        <img src="../img/mango/option-progress-sketch2.png" alt="Mango Health" style="max-width: 330px;">
        <p>I was trying to show progression through hexagons and dotted lines. Having the three different hexagons feel like 3 clickable buttons.</p>

      <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
        <img src="../img/mango/option-progress-sketch.png" alt="Mango Health" style="max-width: 330px;">
        <p>I wanted to show all parts of the “tips” while using background arrows to give a visual hint of progression.</p>

          <ul>          
            <li>Shows the user’s journey with the app</li>
            <li>Visually summarizes how the app works</li>
            <li>Arrows indicates progression</li>
            <li>Paper cut-out look and colorful style matches current branding</li>
            <li>Stays within the current UI design pattern</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="cons">
          <h3>Cons</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Less copy could confuse users</li>
            <li>Limited space on top of dashboard view</li>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <figure class="col-xs-12">
      <img src="../img/mango/final-shadow-1.png" alt="Mango Health" style="max-width: 330px;">
    </figure>
    <div class="col-sm-12">
      <p>My recommendation (above) is the most effective because it gives insight of how to use the app, fits well with the existing UI design pattern, and requires no app changes. I also believe the simple shapes and colorful images match the brand of Mango Health and would motivate the user to click to learn more.</p>

      <h4>Typography</h4>
      <p>I chose to keep Avenir Next for the following reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The letter forms are great contrast to the simplified rounded brand images</li>
        <li>Natively installed font from iOS 6+, no custom fonts needed</li>
        <li>Nice variation of weights</li>
        <li>Legible at small text sizes</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Other design changes</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Gave the card titles in all-caps more letter-spacing for better readability</li>
        <li>Refined the schedule icons to match overall style of the UI</li>
      </ul>
